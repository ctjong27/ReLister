* handling existing group (?)
if there is no item with existing group, then new group of that type can be added
to erase group item, entire group should be deleted (or i guess all items, whatever you want)

* items structure can be reused for group_items

* code structure
item > group
item > user
group > user

* if adding a recipe under recipe, check box recommended to allow retrieval of ingredients

* do not allow a recipe to add itself
